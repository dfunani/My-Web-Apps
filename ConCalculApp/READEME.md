Synopsis: Handy conversion tables show you the formulas to convert from metric system measurements to the imperial system and visa versa allowing you to do your own calculations for the conversion you need. The metric system is a decimalised system of measurement in the sense that all multiples and sub-multiples of the base units are factors of powers of ten of the unit. In the U.S. Americans frequently spell 'metre' as 'meter', and 'litre' as 'liter'; however 'metre' and 'litre' are the official BIPM names for these units.

Metric System
The metric system is a decimalised system of measurement in the sense that all multiples and sub-multiples of the base units are factors of powers of ten of the unit. Fractions of a decimal unit are rarely used.

The metric system, and metre was first fully described by Englishman John Wilkins in 1668 in a treatise presented to the Royal Society some 120 years before the French adopted the system. It is believed that the system was transmitted to France from England via the likes of Benjamin Franklin. In the U.S. Americans frequently spell 'metre' as 'meter', and 'litre' as 'liter'; however 'metre' and 'litre' are the official BIPM names for these units.

Imperial System
Imperial units are the measurement units that were historically used in the British Commonwealth countries. They were very similar, but not identical, to the units that are still predominantly used in the United States. Some of the differences are:

1 U.S. fluid ounce = 1.041 British fluid ounces
1 British fluid ounce = 0.961 U.S. fluid ounce
1 U.S. gallon = 0.833 British Imperial gallon
1 British Imperial gallon = 1.201 U.S. gallons
Our handy conversion tables below show you the formulas to convert from metric system measurements to the imperial system and visa versa allowing you to do your own calculations for the conversion you need. Measurement conversions include weight, mass, length, volume, and temperature.

Hard and Soft Measurement Conversions
Hard Conversions
A hard conversion (adaptive conversion) may not be exactly equivalent. A hard conversion changes the measurement to numbers and units in the new system that are easier to work with. Nominal values are sometimes allowed and used, and a hard conversion sometimes involves a slightly different substitution configuration, or measurement, of the item in question.

Soft Conversions
Some conversion measurements from a system of units to another needs to be exact - this means there is no increasing - or decreasing - the precision of the first measurement unit. This is called soft conversion. Soft conversion does not involve changing the actual physical configuration of the thing that is being measured.
